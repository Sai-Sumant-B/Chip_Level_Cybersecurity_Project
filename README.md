## 📘 Overview

This project explores the **emerging paradigm of chip-level cybersecurity** — embedding security mechanisms directly into silicon to protect modern computing systems from hardware-based vulnerabilities such as Spectre, Meltdown, and side-channel attacks.

Traditional software-based defenses (antivirus, firewalls, IDS/IPS) are increasingly ineffective against threats exploiting hardware flaws.  
This research proposes a new framework called **AHTI (Adaptive Hardware-Level Threat Isolation)** to embed **real-time threat detection, isolation, and dynamic reconfiguration** into chip architectures.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze the **limitations of software-based security**.
- Identify vulnerabilities arising from **modern chip architectures** and supply chain complexity.
- Develop a **hardware/software co-design methodology** for integrating security directly into microchips.
- Propose a **modular hardware-level security model (AHTI)**.

## ⚙️ AHTI Framework (Proposed Model)

**AHTI – Adaptive Hardware-Level Threat Isolation**  
AHTI consists of four key modules working together for real-time defense:

| Module | Function | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **TDM** | Threat Detection Module | Monitors voltage, temperature, and current anomalies using embedded sensors. |
| **RE** | Reconfiguration Engine | Dynamically reconfigures chip behavior to isolate threats. |
| **DRA** | Dynamic Resource Allocation | Redirects workloads from affected components to secure ones. |
| **PMU** | Policy Management Unit | Enforces predefined hardware-level security policies across modules. |

### Key Features:
- AI/ML-powered anomaly detection  
- Hardware-based sandbox isolation  
- Real-time reconfiguration  
- Scalability to IoT and edge devices

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Research and Literature Review:** Examined known chip vulnerabilities (Spectre, Meltdown, Rowhammer).  
2. **Hardware/Software Co-Design:** Integrated protection mechanisms within the chip design process.  
3. **Prototyping:** Simulated the AHTI framework using FPGA environments and testing against various attack vectors.  
4. **Validation:** Measured detection accuracy, power consumption, and latency under multiple conditions.
